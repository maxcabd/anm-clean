# anm-clean
A simple program that removes redundant keyframes from a CyberConnect2 animation (.anm) file.

## Usage
- When baking your animation in Blender, make sure "Visual Keying" is disabled to properly compress the final .anm file.
- Drag and drop a baked .xfbin file on the exe in [releases](https://github.com/maxcabd/anm-clean/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
- Done.
